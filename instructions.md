# Segmentation on Indian Roads: Using UNet and CANET

This project demonstrates the UNet Model intialized on ImageNet Weights and trained on video file filmed by a dashboard cam of a vehicle being driven on indian roads by rendering that video file into individual frames and manually labelling. 

UNet is imported directly from library and initialized on ImageNet Weights.

CANET is implemented from Scratch by referring to the official CANET research paper and then trained on our dataset with no Weight Initialization.
[CANET Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12041.pdf).

All this into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.
